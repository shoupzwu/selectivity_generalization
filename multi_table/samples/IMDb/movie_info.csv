Each redrawn cel was painted in color and then photographed over a colored reproduction of each original background.  Needless to say, the animation quality dropped considerably from the original version with this method. The cartoon was colorized again in 1992, this time with a computer adding color to a new print of the original black and white cartoon.  This preserved the quality of the original animation.",

When he returned to England following WWI a twice decorated soldier, he was noticed by a director who cast him in the lead of _The Call of the Road (1920)_ (qv). Within a few short years, he was a top box office draw in his homeland. Working on an American produced British movie was his stepping stone to Hollywood. His ruggedness was different than the typical Hollywood leading man, which made him stand out and had him cast usually as the tough guy. This on-screen persona was in contrast to his true warm nature with his commitment to family, and his love of rose horticulture. The movie _What Price Glory (1926)_ (qv) began his long time on-screen pairing with actor 'Edmund Lowe (I)' (qv). Arguably his greatest role was his Oscar winning one in _The Informer (1935)_ (qv).

Paolo falls apart after loosing his job and gets caught up in the downward spiral of alcohol and drug abuse. As a result, his wife Francesca leaves him taking with her their ten year old daughter, Maria. What follows is Paolo's personal progression through Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, true to the Divine Comedy format as well as the romanticism of Keats' poetry.
